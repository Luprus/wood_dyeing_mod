# Luprus' Wood Dyeing Mod

à¯¹nce upon a time, Dinnerbone " the Inverted " submitted the idea of adding colored wood planks to Minecraft.

But the idea, even if a large majority of 12 years old wanted it to be real, were lost...
History became legend, legend became myth... And for 10 years, Mojang totally forgot about it.

...

Ok, I lied. They added woods of several shades through the years but, come on !
Acacia is not what I call red !
With which material am I supposed to build my swedish cabin in my favorite swedish game, red concrete ?! Eww ! ðŸ¤¢

That's why, I, Luprus " the Unskilled ", decided to make my own mod, finally adding a feature Minecraft builders wanted for decades ! (only one actually ðŸ˜•)

## ðŸ“– About
The mod will add a new _dye brush_ item that you could use on wood blocks to dye them in the color you want.
Each type of wood will react differently to the dye.
For example, if oak will be red, spruce will be a darker red, burch will be a lighter red, etc...
You get the idea.

You will have to fill the _dye brush_ with dye before using it.
To clean the brush, you will have to interact with water.
Otherwise, the dye will disappear after several uses.

To make the brush, you will need _fibers_ obtainable by slicing sugar cane with a flint.

To clean a block, you will simply use axe to remove the layer of dye.
